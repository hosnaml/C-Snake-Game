This is a Snake game developed on embedded platform a ChipKIT Uno32 board together with the Basic I/O shield.
In this game, a snake is growing on the screen, and the challenge for the players is to make the tail of the snake grow as long as possible.
We will use the small display on the Basic I/O shield to display the game and use the slide switches to move in the vertical direction, 
and the push buttons to move in the horizontal direction. We will use interrupts triggered by the built in timer to update the screen and control the speed of the game.
All the development is done using the MCB32tools and all code is written in C.
The game supports multiplayer mode, and have different difficulty levels.
