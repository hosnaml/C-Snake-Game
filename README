***********************     INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM     ************************* 

For this project we used the cross compiling environment MCB32 specified by the course. To compile the program, you need to open a MCB32 Terminal on your computer. Connect the Uno32 + Basic IO Shield to your computer with an USB cable. Wait a few seconds then type the following into the terminal: 

		make

followed by

		make install

If the project fails to compile, please try to specify the serial number for your device. 

	Linux: This is normally /dev/ttyUSB0 
	Windows: In MSYS2, this is normally /dev/ttyS2 
	Mac: This is normally /dev/cu.usbserial-* (replace * with something)

Then type the make install + path in your terminal window. For example: 

		make install TTYDEV=/dev/tty.usbserial-A503WGL7
